# What is where

All the documentation and diagrams can be seen in the the "Documentation" folder and the execuatable app can be seen in  the "App Executable" folder.  

The Homepage (first scene), has the functionality of adjusting the brightness of the phone's screen light through the use of the accelerometer or by using the slider. The toggle button turns on and off this feature.'

The Roompage (second scene), has the functionality of turning on/off the phone's flashlight\* via a "whip effect" (using the accelerometer). This feature can be toggled on/off with the toggle button. This scene also contains
the functionality of utilizing the light sensor to adjust the phone's screen brightness. I.e. if you hold the phone in a dark setting the brightness will increase and vica versa.

\*The flashlight is used due to us not having back-end access to actual smart lighting / light bulbs. Therefore the user should think of the flashlight as simulating turning on and off a lamp/light, while the screen brightness
should be thought of as simulating adjusting the brightness of a lamp/light.

# Addition

On both pages the user is able to change the positions of either rooms or lightsources. This is done by going into edit mode and dragging the room/lightsource you want to it's desired location.
